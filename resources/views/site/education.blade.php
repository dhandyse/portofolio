        <h1>Software Engineer | CCIT FTUI </h1>
        <p>CCIT is my start of learning programming, at first was actually easy to follow cause I learned logic programming and the workflow of it.
            And as i remembered on second semester it got be harder to follow, cause on this semester you learn how to code and its not that easy to implented whats on your mind to code.
        </p>        
        <p>    In CCIT i had a task to make a project (application, web, and android) every month with the group of two. Because of that repetion i got more understanding how to code and had a teamwork with My partner. 
            Fyi the program language that i learned is Java. So i got graduated in 2021 with CGPA 3.05 and got my professional software engineering certificate from NIIT with DNIIT (Java Technologies). 
        </p>

        <h2>Politeknik Negeri Jakarta</h2>
        <p>Actually my study in Politeknik Negeri Jakarty was along with CCIT. So its quite busy in normal days, but in this univeristy I started learning how to code/program
            on third semester. But with differnet languages, i learned visual basic and php. In this university I'm not just learned programming because it have more subjects to study like
            digital image processing, math, data mining, and etc. Actually I learned python on sixth semester in machine learning subject. 
        </p>
            
        <p>I'm still studying here I'm on seventh semester and actually I'm looking for internship. So please contact me for collaboration or speaking about engagement.</p>
